• Provide logging
• Builder for the endpoint
• Update documentation, Endpoint is no longer a struct.
• Consider making the client and the futures it returs Send
• Closing the connection:
  - Create a relay to terminate it.
  - The receiving end will map this to an infinite stream of ()
  - By .flatten_stream() we get a stream that is infinite, but starts sending only after the relay fired
  - merge the stream with the flattened output of do_msg.
  - Once we get only the () from the terminator, it means we exhausted all the
    things already generated by do_msg (TODO: check that's true, that we don't
    generate anything in a slow way) and no new ones won't get created, because
    we terminated. We can use take_while() to check for that.
  - Use map to clean up after this terminator and get only the real results again.

  - Note: We can't use select, because we kind of want to prefer the left stream when it has data.
• Put the serverctl on the client as well
• Add an option to forcefully close the connection
