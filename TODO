• Provide logging
• Consider making the client and the futures it returs Send (or only when asked for it?)
• Inactivity timeout for the server
• Provide constructors for the endpoint taking the connection directly, not Framed
• Batches on the client side
• Some high-level description how it works, on the docs front page.
• Go through the documentation and use third form everywhere (eg. „returns“ instead of „return“)
• Style RPCError should be RpcError. Same for RPCCallResult and possibly others.
• BoundaryCodec can now be implemented, serde-json now provides error details
