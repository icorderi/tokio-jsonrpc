• Provide logging
• Consider making the client and the futures it returs Send (or only when asked for it?)
• Inactivity timeout for the server
• Provide constructors for the endpoint taking the connection directly, not Framed
• Finished might return some better error than canceled (everything uses IoError around here anyway)
• Consider the .rpc and .notification to take references
• Batches on the client side
