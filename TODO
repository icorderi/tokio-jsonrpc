• Provide logging
• Consider making the client and the futures it returs Send (or only when asked for it?)
• Inactivity timeout for the server
• Provide constructors for the endpoint taking the connection directly, not Framed
• Batches on the client side
• Some high-level description how it works, on the docs front page.
• Go through the documentation and use third form everywhere (eg. „returns“ instead of „return“)
• BoundaryCodec can now be implemented, serde-json now provides error details
• Documentation for the jsonrpc_params macro, with some examples
• An external test to check the macro works with all fancy things like renaming of stuff and not having certain imports.
• Document panics around returning un-jsonizable types
• Try to make the types less complex ‒ this is reportedly the reason for very long compile times ‒ placing Boxes in the middle of the chain *might* help.
