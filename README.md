# Tokio-JSONRPC

This is an implementation of the [JSON RPC
2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol for tokio. It can handle
some of the more niche features, like batches and an endpoint being both the
server and the client at the same time.

This is *work in progress*, most of the functionality is still missing and the
API of what exists is likely to change.
